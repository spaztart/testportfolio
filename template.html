                <h2>A Bit of History:</h2>
                <p>
                  McAfee is a global leader in online protection, serving over 100 million devices worldwide. 
                  In 2020, McAfee underwent rapid organizational changes, with shifts in leadership and evolving company objectives. 
                  Teams across marketing, design, and engineering worked in silos, pushing products out quickly to meet tight deadlines.
                </p>
                <p>This led to visual inconsistencies in our products and varying UX patterns. A few key issues emerged:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Different developer frameworks were used across various products.</li>
                  <li>Designers and developers weren‚Äôt given enough time to research and test UI components to ensure they fit our products.</li>
                  <li>Designers often overrode components with their own styles to match their vision for the products.</li>
                  <li>Documentation and guidelines were lacking.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Given the state of the current design processes, we had to address these challenges by building a design system 
                  that could bring scalability, efficiency, and brand consistency for McAfee‚Äôs products. So how did we accomplish this?
                </p>
              
                <h3>New Beginnings:</h3>
                <p>
                  I joined the design system team in 2021 to take part in leading the design efforts. 
                  As a result, I came up with a phased approach:
                </p>
                <h4>Gain Understanding:</h4>
                <p>
                  I started by meeting with the desktop, mobile, brand, and marketing teams. From here, I analyzed the prime UI libraries 
                  they use for components, icons, and visual foundations. I also learned about the front-end frameworks engineers use. 
                  This helped me define goals and determine success metrics.
                </p>
                <h4>Audit Process:</h4>
                <p>
                  Collaborating with other design teams, I started auditing typefaces, colors, and UI components throughout their design flows, 
                  identifying commonly used UI components, and coming up with a solidified library for McAfee's main base components.
                </p>
                <h4>Design, Build and Test:</h4>
                <p>
                  From scratch, I have created UI components in Figma. For instance, I have built UI specifications, compared new and old components, 
                  and utilized Figma‚Äôs latest component features to make them intuitive for design flows. I have also tested these components 
                  on various McAfee projects to make sure they are responsive, accessible, and purposeful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was making progress in solidifying a new intuitive UI library. I introduced the new libraries to designers, 
                  and they immediately started utilizing them for their design flows. However, there were some massive storms that occurred.
                </p>
              
                <h3>Build a Plane While It‚Äôs Flying 24/7:</h3>
                <p>
                  We work in an organization that takes the ‚Äúagility and flexibility‚Äù approach, making decisions on the fly. 
                  And by no means, I am not knocking this style of work. However, I believe there is always a ‚Äúying and yang‚Äù 
                  of how we approach processes. Thus, rapidly creating a design system for various teams working on different products 
                  and developing new features was tough. This fast pace often meant that there wasn't enough time to adopt the best design processes.
                </p>
                <h4>Time Constraints:</h4>
                <p>
                  The rapid release of product features created multiple parallel projects for designers and engineers, 
                  making it challenging to balance workloads while building a design system.
                </p>
                <h4>Adoption:</h4>
                <p>
                  Some engineering teams resisted adopting the new design system due to bandwidth constraints.
                </p>
                <h4>Leaked UI Libraries:</h4>
                <p>
                  Designers began using new UI components in the design process, leading to a mix of old and new components being used. 
                  This influenced engineers to build their own UI for these components.
                </p>
                <h4>Technical Challenges:</h4>
                <p>
                  Integrating the design system into existing workflows and technologies required careful planning to ensure compatibility 
                  with different platforms, frameworks, and tools used by various teams.
                </p>
                <h4>Lack of Governance:</h4>
                <p>
                  Designers would bring us stakeholder-approved UI components to build because their product engineers didn't have time to create them. 
                  Once the components were built, many were rarely reused by engineers and designers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These dilemmas became challenging. Developers didn‚Äôt have the resources to build new and updated UI components. 
                  Designers were also working at a rapid pace to meet deadlines, which resulted in the use of new and old UI libraries. 
                  Despite these failures, this didn‚Äôt stop the design system team from pushing forward.
                </p>
              
                <h3>Let‚Äôs Take a Step Back:</h3>
                <p>
                  Our team took a step back to identify these challenges. We realized that we need to define what needs to be done for the design system. 
                  Within this work culture, how can we make a successful design system?
                </p>
